The repos here consist of the code implemented for the calculation of the latency of the jpeg decoder develeoped as part of the Vitis Libraries.

The repo "jpegDec_final" consists of the single kernel code used as for this project. The jpeg images at different compression ratios used in the evaluation of the computation accuracy are copied onto the host here, so they can be fed into the jpeg decoder. The file "script_run.sh" runs the jpeg decoder on all the jpeg image files in each of the jpeg image data directories organised according to the compression ratio. The file "calculate_averages.sh" then takes the information from running the jpeg_decoder and calculates the average of latencies for each compression ratio(or quality factor)

The repo jpegDec_hardcode2 consists of the code to hardcode to run 2 jpeg decoder kernels at the same time. Done as a trouble shooting experiment for the experiment in jpegDec_8kernel. This repo consists of the code to run the maximum number of kernels, which is 8 here (as there are only 32 ports available and each kernel uses 4 ports). Both these experiments are facing errors in compiling at the moment and will be worked on in the future.
